            <h2>BEAM Center Internship: Summer of 2022</h2>
            <p class="box-style text">My first occupation was an internship that I got through the STEAM center. The BEAM center is a business partner of the STEAM program, so I was guaranteed to get the job. For about 8 weeks, I was tasked with making something called a "Rube Goldberg Machine" which essentially uses nothing but a chain reaction to work. It was a very fun opportunity, and helped me see how chain reactions can cause certain events to occur.</p>
