            <h2>Bootstrap Website</h2>
            <p>For this project, we had to make a website using Bootstrap 5, which is a CSS framework with a handful of premade assets. Using this, we were taught how to use any and all resources given to us in order to make our jobs easier. The accompanying image is the final product: A working website made with Bootstrap!</p>

            <p> For this project, we had to pick from a list of building layouts and completely protect said building from any cyber attacks (Physical or Online).
