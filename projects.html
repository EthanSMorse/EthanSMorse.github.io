    <h2 class="projects-style text" id="project1">Project 1: PC Building <br> <p class="fontsize text">Our first project for this school-year was putting together our own PCs. During this process, we were taught what each part of a PC does, and why it is needed for the machine to work. The picture displayed on the right is the final product: a fully working PC!</p></h2>

    <h2 class="projects-style text" id="project2">Project 2: Website Development <br> <p class="fontsize text">For our next unit, we used the replit website to get a basic understanding of the html programming language. Using this understanding, we were told to create our own websites. The image displayed on the right is the final product: a basic, yet functional website!</p></h2>

    <h2 class="projects-style text" id="project3">Project 3: SOHO Network <br> <p class="fontsize text">For our third project, we took a dive into networking, learning about all of the machines that are needed to support a wifi connection. We learned of the order that said machines must connect in in order to work. The image displayed on the right is the final product: a diagram of what would be a working SOHO network!</p></h2>

    <h2 class="projects-style text" id="project4">Project 4: Security Controls <br> <p class="fontsize text"> For our fourth project, we had to pick from a list of building layouts and completely protect said building from any cyber attacks (Physical or Online). We learned about the different machines and methods used by many businesses today, and incorperated that knowledge into our projects. The image displayed on the right is the final product: a fully protected business!</p></h2>

    <h2 class="projects-style text2 center" id="project5">Project 5: In-Depth Website Development <br> <p class="fontsize text2 center">For our fifth and final project up to this point, we had to take a deeper look into the inner workings of HTML and CSS, with the website being both much more aesthetically pleasing, and holding more content overall this time around. As for an image, you're looking at it. Thats right, its this website!</p></h2>
