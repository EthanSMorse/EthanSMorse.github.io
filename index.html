            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>My name is Ethan Morse. If you're reading this, I can only assume that you either used a link provided to you, or stumbled across it by complete coincidence. Either way, don't be afraid to check things out!</p>
            <br>
            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Being born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, it is safe to say that my life has not been without ease and extremely loud background noise. I've had a very nice and easy academic life, usually passing any tests or quizzes thrown at me with relative ease. When it comes to social life, however, I can't say I'm an expert. I'm very usually a quiet kid, trying to avoid any and all social interaction whenever possible. I've never been a good "team player" and would most certainly prefer to work in a solitary job.</p>
